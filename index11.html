<p>The term NOR is derived from the complement of OR. It implies the OR junction with an inverted output. The operation of NOR gate is such that the output is high only when all its inputs are low and when any one of the inputs is high the output is low.
Y = ~(a | b)
EX-OR GATE:
The output is high only when the inputs are at opposite level.
Y = a ^ b
EX-NOR GATE:
The output is high only when the inputs are at same level.
Y = ~(a ^ b)
